Parody of Gilbert and Sullivan's Modern Major General (I welcome PRs from more lyrically talented people).

**\[DATA SCIENTIST\]**  
I am the very model of the modern Data Scientist  
With variables categorical, ordinal, continuous  
I know ML libraries, and fit models optimal  
from logistic curve to KNN, by parameter numerical  
I can render graphics, too, in quality cinematical  
Draw distributions, both KDE and histogrammical  
About visualising libraries I’m brimming with a lot of news  
With many cheerful facts about the Seaborne palette colour hues

**\[CHORUS\]**  
With many cheerful facts about the Seaborne palette colour hues  
With many cheerful facts about the Seaborne palette colour hues  
With many cheerful facts about the Seaborne palette co-colour-colour hues  

**\[DATA SCIENTIST\]**  
I’m very good at differential model weight gradation  
I can even do deep neural network error back propagation  
In short with variables categorical, ordinal, continuous  
I am the very model of the modern Data Scientist!  

**\[CHORUS\]**  
In short with variables categorical, ordinal, continuous  
They are the very model of the modern Data Scientist  

**\[DATA SCIENTIST\]**  
I can grok a dataset, both structured or sensory  
Reshape table data, feature engineer as necessary  
I hot encode the categoricals and normalise the scalers  
Then convolute the textures and reproject your spatial rasters  
Your dataset I can both describe and artificially recreate  
Pair plot your feature matrix to visualise their correlate  
Report feature relations which I’ll present with clarity  
and re-encode the data to reduce dimensionality  

**\[CHORUS\]**  
And re-encode the data to reduce dimensionality  
And re-encode the data to reduce dimensionality  
And re-encode the data to reduce dia-dimensionality  

**\[DATA SCIENTIST\]**  
I can resample time series to intervals uniform  
And tell you every detail of string format times parameter form  
But still with variables categorical, ordinal, continuous  
I am the very model of the modern Data Scientist!  

**\[CHORUS\]**  
In short with variables categorical, ordinal, continuous  
They are the very model of the modern Data Scientist  

**\[DATA SCIENTIST\]**  
In fact, when I know what is meant by heteroscedasticity  
When I know how to detect and deal with multicollinearity  
Once the perils of imbalanced data I’m more wary at  
And when I know precisely what is meant by covariate  
When I'm familiar with the progress made in reinforcement learning  
When I know more statistics than a MOOC taught yearling  
In short, when I’ve achieved undergraduate level numeracy  
You’ll say a better Data Scientist never coded analytically  

**\[CHORUS\]**  
You’ll say a better Data Scientist never coded analytically  
You’ll say a better Data Scientist never coded analytically  
You’ll say a better Data Scientist never coded ana-analytically  

**\[DATA SCIENTIST\]**  
For my academic knowledge though I’ve greatness yet unforeseen  
Has only been brought down from the beginning of twenty seventeen  
But still with variables categorical, ordinal, continuous  
I am the very model of the modern Data Scientist!  

**\[CHORUS\]**  
But still with variables categorical, ordinal, continuous  
They are the very model of the modern Data Scientist
